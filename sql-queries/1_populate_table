-- best to import from file than try to use SQL
USE olympics
DROP TABLE athlete_events
-- table imported via SQL Server Import, original table must be dropped.

--importation notes:
-- age, height and weight were auto imported as tiny ints, but include value NA so were changed to nvarchar
-- name and event were auto imported with nvarchar(50), but needed nvarchar(300)
