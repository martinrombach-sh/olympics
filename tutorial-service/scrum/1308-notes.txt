Note: you tried to do too much at once last time you initiated the project
Break down the task of moving to the 'olympics/tutorial' structure

1. Refactoring
separate olympics-service into the service and a new tutorial-service

2. Bug on TutorialUser in TutorialUserRepository
Corrected: it was extra code from the next stage in the tutorial, unfinished.

------------------------------------ CURRENT -------------------------------------------

3. SQL error when calling via swagger (internal 500)

4. Refactoring - removing 'Tutorial' from the names of the tutorial-service files

5. Continue and finish tutorial + testing tutorial

6. Start olympics based on tutorial
